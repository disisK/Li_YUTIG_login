	<p class="solid">What is ClAY Go? The term ClAY Go stands for Clean As You Go. It is a policy where everyone must clean their area after they finish using it. In the Philippines, ClAY GO was implemented in 2011. As some people practice this every day, it has become their habit. However, some people frequently fail to do this when they cause a mess. To further know about ClAY GO, enjoy exploring this website now! </p>
	<h2 id="c2">Why Practice ClAY GO?</h2>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="column">
			<p>ClAY GO is observed everywhere, but it is more common in fast food chains or malls. This method helps the area to keep it neat and clean. And also to reduce threats to hygiene, health, and safety. Therefore, we must ensure that our used utensils on the tables are arranged neatly and ready to be cleaned, including the table.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="column">
			<p>Practicing ClAY GO is one way of showing care for the environment. Additionally, it has positive benefits for the environment, like keeping it clean. A clean environment is pleasant to be in and does not put us at risk for illness. </p>
		</div>	
		<div class="column">
			<p>We know that there are street sweepers or janitors who clean up the mess around us. Instead of letting them clean our mess, we should do it by ourselves. This way it will lessen their work and keep the area clean. </p>

	<div class="last">
		<p id="c3">Every day we see garbage around us because of those people who litter their trash everywhere. This is one of the factors that has adverse effects on the environment. Citing a 2021 report, Metro Manila generated 3,466,469 metric tons of trash based on the projected 2020 waste generation (Mayuga, 2021). Furthermore, the ClAY GO policy is one of the ways to help lessen the trash that can be seen everywhere, like the side of the road or near the sea. However, some people don't practice this policy. Therefore, to help the environment, a sign "ClAY GO" must be displayed on fast food chains, malls, etc., so people are encouraged to apply this. </p></div>
